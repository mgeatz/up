      <h2 id="compare">UP Airway</h2>
      <p>We operate on unique principles and business strategy. What makes us special?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h5>FLAT RATE:</h5>
          Pricing your trip is easy. Each seat costs $725.00 per flight (before tax). Simple.</li>
        <li><h5>FEWER STRANGERS:</h5>
          We market to all travelers, but each flight is limited to 10 passengers.</li>
        <li><h5>GOODBYE WAITING:</h5>
          Waiting is wasteful. No more long lines and overkill security.</li>
        <li><h5>COMFORT:</h5>
          Every seat is over sized - boasting plenty of room for your legs and elbows.</li>
        <li><h5>RED CARPET SERVICE:</h5>
          Unlike big airlines, UP Airway actually respects our customers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Customer service is something lacking in the air transportation business, but we are bringing it back! Each UP
        Airway flight features celebrity style service.</p>

      <div class="collapse" id="boarding">
        <p>Get excited about flying again, because we're bringing back the glits and glam.</p>
        <p>Things happen fast at UP Airway, but play it safe, and plan to arrive 30 minutes prior to takeoff.
        When you enter the airport follow the (UP Airway) arrows - they lead to a desk where you will physically check-in.
        At the desk we do a quick sweep of your baggage to make sure you have no contraband (drugs, guns, bombs...the usual stuff).
          After inspection you will be provided a lanyard; carry it close - it is your boarding pass!</p>
        <p>At this point you can make your way past the desk, and out the door. Follow the red carpet to the UP Airway Jet.
          Red carpet customer experience is provided on every flight (we literally roll a red carpet). When you reach the
          plane your pilots will greet you. Show them your passes. Pose for a quick Facebook picture, take a selfie, or skip
          the pics and go straight into the plane.</p>
        <p>Flight time is roughly 3.5 hours. There are no stewarts, so make yourself at home (the fridge is up front, bathroom
          is in the back, iPads are in the seats with the wifi password printed on the back).</p>
        <small>During flight, please be
          respectful of others around you. No smoking, public drunkenness, physical outbursts, etc...just chill.</small>

      <p>After de-boarding the airplane, you can use our ground shuttle service or arrange for other transportation.</p>
      <p>Planning to rent a vehicle when you reach your destination? We can help with that. Our continuous ground
        shuttle service provides ground transporation <b>from</b> the airport to nearby popular vehicle rental stations.
        Rental stations positioned along the red route path in the images below are available dropoff points our ground
        shuttle service.</p>
